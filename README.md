## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

One of the main things I learned was about centralizing without Flex Box or Grids, by using some concepts about the use of "position: absolute";

```css
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
```

### Continued development

This was one of the ways I learned how to centralize, which was one of my biggest challenges in this project, cause I'm a beginner. I pretend to delve deeper into techniques involving CSS Flex Box and Grid in the future and updates my techniques.
